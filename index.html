    <div class="panel">
    We construct an empirical measure of expected network spillovers that arise through default cascades for the US financial system for the period 2002-2016. Compared to existing studies, we include a much larger cross-section of US financial firms that comprise all bank holding companies, all broker-dealers and all insurance companies, and consider their entire empirical balance sheet exposures instead of relying on simulations or on exposures arising just through one specific market (like the Fed Funds market) or one specific financial instrument (like credit default swaps). We find negligible expected spillovers from 2002 to 2007 and from 2013 to 2016. However, between 2008 and 2012, we find that default spillovers can amplify expected losses by up to 25\%, a significantly higher estimate than previously found in the literature.

<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show that inflation risk is priced in the cross-section of US stock returns. The inflation risk premium varies over time conditional on the nominal-real covariance, the time-varying relation between inflation and the real economy. Using a consumption-based equilibrium asset pricing model, we argue that inflation is priced because it predicts real consumption growth. The historical changes in the predictability of consumption with inflation, which are mediated by the nominal-real covariance, can account for the size, variability, predictability and sign-reversals --last observed in the 2000s-- in the inflation risk premium.

<dd>
    with Tobias Adrian. September, 2017.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We present a microfounded New Keynesian model that features financial vulnerabilities. Financial intermediaries' occasionally binding value at risk constraints give rise to vulnerabilities that generate time varying downside risk of the output gap. Monetary policy impacts the output gap directly via the IS curve, and indirectly via its impact on the tightness of the value at risk constraint. The optimal monetary policy rule always depends on nancial vulnerabilities in addition to output, inflation, and the real rate. We show that a classic Taylor rule exacerbates downside risk of GDP growth relative to an optimal Taylor rule, thus generating welfare losses associated with negative skewness of GDP growth.

<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    I study how central banks should communicate monetary policy in liquidity trap scenarios in which the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding. Using a standard New Keynesian model, I argue that the key to preventing self-fulfilling deflationary spirals and anchoring expectations is to promise to keep  nominal interest rates pegged at zero for a length of time that depends on the state of the economy. I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for this type of state contingent forward guidance to implement the welfare maximizing equilibrium as a globally determinate (i.e., unique) equilibrium. Even though the zero lower bound prevents the Taylor principle from holding, determinacy can be obtained if the central bank sufficiently extends the duration of the zero interest rate peg in response to deflationary or contractionary changes in expectations or outcomes. Fiscal policy is passive, so it plays no role for determinacy. The interest rate rules I consider are easy to communicate, require little institutional change and do not entail any unnecessary social welfare losses.

<dd>
    with Thomas Eisenbach. February, 2015.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We construct a new systemic risk measure that quantifies vulnerability to fire-sale spillovers using detailed repo market data for broker-dealers and regulatory balance sheet data for U.S. bank holding companies. For broker-dealers, vulnerabilities in the repo market are driven by flight-to-quality episodes, when liquidity and leverage can change rapidly. We estimate that an exogenous 1 percent decline in the price of all assets financed with repos leads to losses owing to fire-sale spillovers of 8 percent of total broker-dealer equity on average and over 12 percent during the financial crisis. For bank holding companies, vulnerabilities to fire sales are equally sizable but build up slowly over time. Our measure signals buildup of systemic risk starting in the early 2000s, ahead of many other measures. Our measure also predicts low quantiles of macroeconomic outcomes above and beyond other existing measures, especially at longer horizons.

<dd>
    with Leonid Kogan and Dmitry Livdan. April, 2012.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    In this paper we study the relation between returns on the aggregate stock market and ggregate real investment. While it is well known that the aggregate investment rate is negatively correlated with subsequent excess stock market returns, we find that it is positively correlated with future stock market volatility. Thus, conditionally on past aggregate investment, the mean-variance tradeoff in aggregate stock returns is negative. We interpret these patterns within a general equilibrium production economy. In our model, investment is determined endogenously in response to two types of shocks: shocks to productivity and preference shocks affecting discount rates. Preference shocks affect expected stock returns, aggregate investment rate, and stock return volatility in equilibrium, helping model reproduce the empirical relations between these variables. Thus, our results emphasize that the time-varying price of aggregate risk plays and important role in shaping the aggregate investment dynamics.

<dd>
    with Sahar Parsa. May, 2013.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show a novel relation between the institutional investors’ intrinsic trading frequency—a commonly used proxy for the investors’s investment horizon— and the cross-section of stock returns. We show that the 20% of stocks with the lowest trading frequency earn mean returns that are 6 percentage points per year higher than the 20% of stocks that have the highest trading frequency. The magnitude and predictability of these returns persist or even increase when risk-adjusted by common indicators of systematic risks such as the Fama-French, liquidity or momentum factors. Our results show that the characteristics of stock holders affect expected returns of the very securities they hold, supporting the view that heterogeneity among investors is an important dimension of asset prices.

<dd>
    with Jonas Mishara-Blomberger. December, 2012.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show that firms in models with menu costs, when calibrated to have the empirically observed frequency and size of individual-goods price adjustments, have stock returns that are always positively correlated with inflation. The cross-sectional dispersion in this correlation is almost negligible, even though firms have very diverse micro-level pricing behavior. Because in this class of models positive nominal shocks are good states of nature and the correlation between stock returns and inflation is positive, agents are willing to pay a premium to hold assets whose returns covary negatively with inflation. In contrast, we empirically find that the dispersion in the correlation between stock returns and inflation is about 100 times larger than in the model, and that correlations are negative about half the time. Furthermore, and also at odds with sticky-price models, investors require a premium to hedge against states of high inflation. Because firms’ heterogeneity is the key mechanism that generates a high degree of monetary non-neutrality in the models, our results suggest that we do not yet have a full account of the monetary transmission mechanism, and that asset prices can provide important information about it.

    <div class="panel">
        Loose financial conditions forecast high output growth and low output volatility up to six quarters into the future, generating time varying downside risk to the output gap which we measure by GDP-at-Risk (GaR). This finding is robust across countries, conditioning variables, and time periods. We study the implications for monetary policy in a reduced form New Keynesian model with financial intermediaries that are subject to a Value at Risk (VaR) constraint. Optimal monetary policy depends on the magnitude downside risk to GDP, as it impacts the consumption-savings decision via the Euler constraint, and the financial conditions via the tightness of the VaR constraint. The optimal monetary policy rule exhibits a pronounced response to shifts in financial conditions for most countries in our sample. Welfare gains from taking financial conditions into account are shown to be sizable.

        We estimate the equity risk premium (ERP) by combining information from twenty models. The ERP in 2012 and 2013 reached heightened levels — of around 12 percent — not seen since the 1970s. We conclude that the high ERP was caused by unusually low Treasury yields.
