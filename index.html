<dd>
    with Tobias Adrian. March, 2017.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We present a microfounded New Keynesian model that features financial vulnerabilities. Financial intermediaries' occasionally binding value at risk constraints give rise to vulnerabilities that generate time varying downside risk of the output gap. Monetary policy impacts the output gap directly via the IS curve, and indirectly via its impact on the tightness of the value at risk constraint. The optimal monetary policy rule always depends on nancial vulnerabilities in addition to output, inflation, and the real rate. We show that a classic Taylor rule exacerbates downside risk of GDP growth relative to an optimal Taylor rule, thus generating welfare losses associated with negative skewness of GDP growth.

<dd>
    December, 2016.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    I give necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of interest rate feedback rules to eliminate self-fulfilling deflations and all other undesired equilibria in a standard New Keynesian economy with a binding zero lower bound. When the interest rate rule is continuous in the state of the economy, keeping interest rates pegged at zero for a long enough initial period and then switching to a Taylor rule that does not obey the Taylor principle is necessary and sufficient to implement the welfare-maximizing equilibrium in a globally determinate (that is, unique) way. When the interest rate rule is not continuous, the previous condition is still sufficient but no longer necessary. Fiscal policy is passive, so monetary policy anchors expectations on its own. The interest rate rules I consider do not require central banks to undergo any institutional change and do not rely on the neo- Fisherian mechanism of inducing an increase in inflation by first increasing interest rates.

<dd>
    with Thomas Eisenbach. February, 2015.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We construct a new systemic risk measure that quantifies vulnerability to fire-sale spillovers using detailed repo market data for broker-dealers and regulatory balance sheet data for U.S. bank holding companies. For broker-dealers, vulnerabilities in the repo market are driven by flight-to-quality episodes, when liquidity and leverage can change rapidly. We estimate that an exogenous 1 percent decline in the price of all assets financed with repos leads to losses owing to fire-sale spillovers of 8 percent of total broker-dealer equity on average and over 12 percent during the financial crisis. For bank holding companies, vulnerabilities to fire sales are equally sizable but build up slowly over time. Our measure signals buildup of systemic risk starting in the early 2000s, ahead of many other measures. Our measure also predicts low quantiles of macroeconomic outcomes above and beyond other existing measures, especially at longer horizons.

<dd>
    with Martijn Boons, Frans de Roon, and Marta Szymanowska. July, 2016.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show that inflation risk is priced in the cross section of U.S. stock returns with a price of inflation risk that is comparable in magnitude to that of the aggregate market. The inflation risk premium varies over time conditional on the nominal-real covariance—the time-varying relation between inflation and the real economy. Using a consumption-based equilibrium asset pricing model, we argue that inflation is priced because it predicts real consumption growth. The historical changes in the predictability of consumption with inflation, which are mediated by the nominal-real covariance, can account for the size, variability, predictability, and sign reversals— last observed in the 2000s—in the inflation risk premium.

<dd>
    with Leonid Kogan and Dmitry Livdan. April, 2012.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    In this paper we study the relation between returns on the aggregate stock market and ggregate real investment. While it is well known that the aggregate investment rate is negatively correlated with subsequent excess stock market returns, we find that it is positively correlated with future stock market volatility. Thus, conditionally on past aggregate investment, the mean-variance tradeoff in aggregate stock returns is negative. We interpret these patterns within a general equilibrium production economy. In our model, investment is determined endogenously in response to two types of shocks: shocks to productivity and preference shocks affecting discount rates. Preference shocks affect expected stock returns, aggregate investment rate, and stock return volatility in equilibrium, helping model reproduce the empirical relations between these variables. Thus, our results emphasize that the time-varying price of aggregate risk plays and important role in shaping the aggregate investment dynamics.

<dd>
    with Sahar Parsa. May, 2013.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show a novel relation between the institutional investors’ intrinsic trading frequency—a commonly used proxy for the investors’s investment horizon— and the cross-section of stock returns. We show that the 20% of stocks with the lowest trading frequency earn mean returns that are 6 percentage points per year higher than the 20% of stocks that have the highest trading frequency. The magnitude and predictability of these returns persist or even increase when risk-adjusted by common indicators of systematic risks such as the Fama-French, liquidity or momentum factors. Our results show that the characteristics of stock holders affect expected returns of the very securities they hold, supporting the view that heterogeneity among investors is an important dimension of asset prices.

<dd>
    with Jonas Mishara-Blomberger. December, 2012.
<button class="accordion">&ensp;Abstract&ensp;</button>
    <div class="panel">
    We show that firms in models with menu costs, when calibrated to have the empirically observed frequency and size of individual-goods price adjustments, have stock returns that are always positively correlated with inflation. The cross-sectional dispersion in this correlation is almost negligible, even though firms have very diverse micro-level pricing behavior. Because in this class of models positive nominal shocks are good states of nature and the correlation between stock returns and inflation is positive, agents are willing to pay a premium to hold assets whose returns covary negatively with inflation. In contrast, we empirically find that the dispersion in the correlation between stock returns and inflation is about 100 times larger than in the model, and that correlations are negative about half the time. Furthermore, and also at odds with sticky-price models, investors require a premium to hedge against states of high inflation. Because firms’ heterogeneity is the key mechanism that generates a high degree of monetary non-neutrality in the models, our results suggest that we do not yet have a full account of the monetary transmission mechanism, and that asset prices can provide important information about it.
